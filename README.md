# Soft Workspace

This repo currently contains **two** projects:

- **`/` (root)**: `Soft Goals Manager` — a Node/Express goals demo (legacy)
- **`vital_coach/`**: `Vital Coach` — the private men's health / life-OS app (**Flutter**, Android + Windows)

## Soft Goals Manager (legacy)

This section describes the legacy Node/Express app. (You can keep it, or we can move it into `legacy/` later.)

This application includes:

- A **command-line interface (CLI)** for managing goals via terminal commands.
- A **RESTful API server** built with Express.js that stores goals in a JSON file.
- A **web front-end** (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) that interacts with the API to add, list, complete and delete goals.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 14 or higher.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danilbr235-beep/Soft.git
cd Soft
npm install
```

## Running the Web Application

Start the Express server, which serves the API and static files in `/public`:

```bash
npm start
```

The server listens on port 3000 by default. Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the web interface.

The web interface allows you to:

- Add a new goal.
- View the list of existing goals.
- Mark a goal as complete.
- Delete a goal.

All goals are stored in `goals.json`.

## Using the CLI

The CLI script (`index.js`) provides similar functionality via the terminal:

```bash
node index.js add "Learn Node.js"
node index.js list
node index.js complete 1
node index.js delete 1
```

Pass `--help` to see usage instructions.
